1. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd BreadBoard
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Directory Structure  
- `src/`: Contains all the source code  
- `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests  
- `docs/`: Documentation files
- `public/`: Static files

## Available Scripts  
- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Runs the tests.
- `npm build`: Builds the app for production.

## Common Issues and Solutions  
- **Issue:** Running `npm install` throws errors.  
  **Solution:** Ensure you have Node.js properly installed and check network connectivity.
- **Issue:** App fails to start.  
  **Solution:** Check for any omitted steps in the setup and ensure no port conflicts.
